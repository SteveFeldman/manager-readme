# Hi, I'm Steve
Welcome to the team! Iâ€™m so glad you have joined us. I'm really looking forward to getting to know you on a professional basis and working together to help you achieve your career goals.

This readme covers what to expect when working with me. It's an operator's manual of the sorts about how I like to work, my norms and values, as well as some general expectations of what it is like working together. This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## A Quick Intro of Sorts
I did not have the traditional route of becoming a software engineer, a development manager and eventually a software executive as most folks in the industry. As you can see from my [LinkedIn profile]|(https://www.linkedin.com/in/feldmansteve/), I didn't graduate with a Computer Science degree. It wasn't even a consideration for me back in the day, as CS majors simply weren't as prevelant at my University at the time. I took several CS classes and left school with a cursory understanding of C and C++. I was fortunate enough to find a job as a software engineer without a CS degree. It took a lot of hardwork and endless nights at Barnes and Noble, as well as Border's Books reading every software language book you can imagine. My nights and weekends were filled for 5 years straight as I put myself through my own CS degree.

I was fortunate enough to learn Java right after school at a time when everyone was starting to learn Java. It's like a developer now learning GoLang or other modern languages with less than a few years of existence. I eventually did move forward with a Master's Degree in Systems Engineering.

I think it's important to make this the first impression as it tells you a lot about me as a person. I'm a big believer in the human spirit and the will to accomplish anything and everything that you put your mind to!

On a personal level, I'm married and have two daughters that I do hope will one day pursue a career in some technical discipline. You may often hear me talk about my daughters from time to time during our conversations.

## My Role as a Team Leader
I am here to make sure our team is successful, motivated, and working on the things that are most important to help our customers, improve our products, and grow our business. A lot of my energy is placed in attracting and retaining great talent locally, nationally and globally. 

You may ask from time to time why I'm so hyper-focused on recruiting, whether it be our next class of summer interns or graduates in Computer Science, a portion of every day is spent working in some capacity in a recruiting effort. I believe you should always be recruiting. I like to involve my team in every layer of the recruiting process so that they feel a part of growing our team. Team members participate in recruiting events at Universities, Tech Bootcamps and conferences. They are part of the interview process, as well as the selection process. 

Recruiting is only a small part of the job. Once an team member joins our group, we have to make them successful. We put a lot of emphasis on training and orientation. I'm a big believer in taking the time to train team members. It not only makes the new team member more prepared, but it puts the accountability and ownership of readiness on the team member(s) responsible for leading the training and orientation.

## How I Approach my Job
To many I come off very confident in my work and my interactions with my team. Overall, I am very big on delegating and giving my team the resources they need to be independent. My #1 goal as a manager is for team members to be in a position of defining and directing their own work at all times. I ask that all of my teammates strive for professional indepenence. It's no fun to be an order taker.

### Continuous Improvement
I am a firm believer that what got you here won't necessarily be what gets you to the next step or place in your career. It's great to have solid fundamentals as an engineer, a leader and a person. I really do expect my teammates to want to continuous improve. I like process...but most importantly, I like seeing the evolution of process.

### One on One's
I'm not a traditionalist when it comes to one on one's. I've done them many ways with my team. What I tell my team is that one on one time is their time. If they want to use the time, then they should schedule it and coordinate what we cover. 

When I want time from my team, I generally reach out and schedule time. I like to get as much face to face time as possible. If I'm in the same physical location, then I like to get out of the office and walk. If my team member is remote, then I like to have 1 on 1's away from the office where there are fewer distractions. The best time to get me is in the car on my way to work or way home.

### Feedback
I generally like to think of myself as someone who strives to be as direct and forethcoming as possible. Some people like and some people do not. It's in my DNA, so I ask all of my team members to understand that my feedback is not personal. 

I like to be on the receiving side of feedback. I like it to be synchronous, preferrably face to face, or at worst over the phone. Giving feedback over email or text isn't something I'm keen with. I understand that some folks in the world feel most comfortable giving feedback asynchronously. 

### Transparency
I don't know if it needs to be said or if it's just implied. If we are working together, unless this is your first job, you've likely left another job to come work with me. People leave jobs all of the time. It's no fun to see teammates leave you to go to other places. It happens and it's a natural part of your professional life. Be transparent with yourself, your teammates and your manager.

### If You Need Me
My calendar is often a mess. It's not something I'm proud of. It's definitely something I need to improve upon. I'm always willing and available to talk with anyone from my team. It might not always fit in the standard M-F (9 to 6) schedule. I take calls at night, early morning and the weekend. I take visits and office hours out of schedule as well. Drop me a note, send me a text or swing by my office. I will always find a time to meet with you.
